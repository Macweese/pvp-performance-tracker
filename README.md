Tracks PvP performance by keeping track of various stats. Only useful for 1v1 PvP fights that involve overhead prayers and/or gear switching, Last Man Standing being the perfect example. Multi will cause problems. **Potentially inaccurate outside of LMS**, but generally fine. 

This plugin was created in collaboration with [Mazhar, @maz_rs on twitter](https://twitter.com/maz_rs).
