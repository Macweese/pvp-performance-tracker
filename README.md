# PvP Performance Tracker

Tracks PvP performance by keeping track of various stats. Only useful for 1v1 PvP fights that involve overhead prayers and/or gear switching, LMS being the perfect example. Multi will cause problems. Potentially inaccurate outside of LMS. 

This plugin was created in collaboration with [Mazhar, @maz_rs on twitter](https://twitter.com/maz_rs), [@voiderman1337](https://github.com/voiderman1337) on github.

I would love to see other features/stats come into this plugin in the future, feel free to submit issues/suggestions & PRs. If you find a weapon that doesn't work, let me know as well.
